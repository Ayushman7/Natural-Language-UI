Introduction

Natural Language User Interfaces (LUI or NLUI) are a type of computer human interface where linguistic phenomena such as verbs, phrases and clauses act as UI controls for creating, selecting and modifying data in software applications.

In interface design natural language interfaces are sought after for their speed and ease of use, but most suffer the challenges to understanding wide varieties of ambiguous input.[1] Natural language interfaces are an active area of study in the field of natural language processing and computational linguistics. An intuitive general Natural language interface is one of the active goals of the Semantic Web. 

Concept

The idea is to turn a classic form into one that uses natural language to obtain information from the user. For that we’ll construct a sentence where some words and parts are select elements and text inputs. We’ll then transform the select elements so that we can customize them.
Natural language forms are quite suitable for some UI cases, not for all, of course. They have a couple of limitations but they can also be more engaging for users if used in the right place and in the right way.

Example Applications

Wearables, because inputs are limited for wearable devices, speaking is a natural possibility.
Medical, disabilities, many people have difficulty typing due to physical limitations such as repetitive strain injuries (RSI), muscular dystrophy, and many others.
